# Who Is This For?

## Who Will Get the Most Benefit?
This book is written for those who know the fundamentals of Laravel and are looking to see more advanced examples of implementing their knowledge in a testable and maintainable manner.

From the lessons here, you will see how to apply architectural concepts to Laravel in a variety of ways, with the hope that you can use and adapt them for your own needs.

## What To Know Ahead of Time
We all have varying levels of knowledge. This book is written for those who are familiar with Laravel 4 and its core concepts. It therefore assumes some knowledge of the reader.

Taylor Otwell's book [*Laravel: From Apprentice to Artisan*](https://leanpub.com/laravel) is a great prerequisite. Although I'll cover these on a basic level, readers will hopefully already have a basic understanding of the principles of SOLID and Laravel's IoC container.
