# A Note on Opinions

Knowing the benefits (and pitfalls!) of Repository, Dependency Injection, Container, Service Locator patterns and other tools from our architectural tool set can be both liberating and exciting.

The use of those tools, however, can be plagued with unexpected and often nuanced issues.

As such, there are many opinions about how to go about crafting "good code" with such tools.

As I use many real examples in this book, I have implicitly (and sometimes explicitly!) included my own opinions in this book. Always, however, inform your own opinion with both what you read and your own experience!
